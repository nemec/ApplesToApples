Apples to Apples built into a networked client/server application.
Soon to have an Android app so that multiple people can play on their phones.
Currently, only a cli client is available (ApplesClient.java).

Only one room. A room manager will eventually be built to handle joining, etc.


Running
=======
Compile and run the ApplesRoom class. It will wait for three connections
before starting a round. Compile and run the ApplesClient class for each
player. Players may join at any time, but will only be allowed to play
when the current round ends. The default number of rounds is 10, but may be
set to any value (or -1 for infinite).
